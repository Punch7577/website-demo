<h2 id="paragraph_title_1" style="text-align: center; color: #000;">What was the conquest of Alexander the Great?</h2>
<p id="paragraph_1"; style="text-align: center; color: #000;">Alexander the Great’s conquest, also referred to as the Wars of Alexander the Great, was a period of territorial expansion marked by numerous armed conflicts which lasted for 13 years (336 BCE - 323 BCE). Alexander III of Macedon, known better as Alexander the Great conquered the Persian empire, mainly to liberate Greece from Persian rule and for vengeance due to the Persian invasion of Greece under King Xerxes<a href="#Bibliography_contents_1">[1]</a>. The empire that was created by Alexander by the end of the conquest spanned over 2 million square miles (5179976 square kilometers) and was spread across 3 continents. The empire had territory in the Balkan peninsula, north east Africa and across the Middle East<a href="#Bibliography_contents_2">[2]</a>.

<h2 id="paragraph_title_2" style="text-align: center; color: #000;">What military techniques and tactics were used?</h2>
<p id="paragraph_2" style="text-align: center; color: #000;">Alexander the great and his troops mainly relied on the phalanx and cavalry to defeat the Persians. A phalanx is a military formation that involves a rectangular or square shaped formation of heavy infantry armed with polearm weapons. Although this formation had a lack of maneuverability and a vulnerability from the sides and back, the formation proved effective as a wall of soldiers that could overwhelm the enemy. Cavalry (soldiers who fight on horseback) armed with polearm weapons were used to attack enemy flanks<a href="#Bibliography_contents_3">[3]</a>. The military of Alexander the Great primarily used two weapons: the xiphos, a small double edged sword used for close quarters combat, and the sarissa, an exceptionally long polearm weapon used by the phalanxes and cavalry. There were also archers and “slingers” (soldiers who used slings to launch rocks). The military primarily used these tactics against the Persians to counter their use of longbows. The xiphos was used as an effective close range weapon, the sarissa offered a range advantage and the archers and slingers worked as ranged soldiers<a href="#Bibliography_contents_4">[4]</a>. The main challenge that came for the Greeks was the sheer manpower of the Persian empire as well as their technologically advanced weaponry. They also struggled with the Persian navy and the environment of the vast Persian empire<a href="#Bibliography_contents_5">[5]</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="paragraph_title_3" style="text-align: center; color: #000;">What was the legacy of the conquest?</h2>
<p id="paragraph_3" style="text-align: center; color: #000;">The aftermath of the conquest of Alexander the Great led to Macedonian rule being much more widespread. Territory ranged from The Balkan peninsula all the way to modern day Pakistan and India. This massive expansion of territory led to Greek culture being widespread across vast parts of the Middle East and Asia, as well as Africa. The death of Alexander after the conquest led to the Hellenistic period which saw mass cultural exchange and spread Greek culture and influence<a href="#Bibliography_contents_6">[6]</a>. The Greek language, Greek coin, the development of natural sciences, trade networks and the eventual rise of the Roman and Byzantine empires and the spread of Christianity marks a long lasting legacy for the conquest<a href="#Bibliography_contents_7">[7]</a>. The wars of Alexander the Great continue to be used in education to study History, Social Studies, English and other topics all across the Western world in middle school and high school <a href="#Bibliography_contents_8">[8]</a>. Alexander's military feats and the extent of his empire's influence are the main things studied. Both academic institutions and online media glorify the success of the Greeks in the 21st century.

<h2 id="paragraph_title_4" style="text-align: center; color: #000;">Which notable Greeks participated in this conflict?</h2>
<p id="paragraph_4" style="text-align: center; color: #000;">Several notable figures participated in the conquest. One of the most notable figures is Parmenion, the chief military lieutenant who fought in the conquest. He fought for Philip II of Macedon, the king of Macedonia and father of Alexander the Great. Opinions about Parmenion varied but were mainly positive. He was considered one of, if not the best officer in Alexander the Great’s military. However, after his son, Philotas was executed for treason, Alexander assassinated Parmenion <a href="#Bibliography_contents_9">[9]</a>. Another notable Greek person who fought in the conquest was Antipater who was a general, regent and statesman who was responsible for running Greece during his time as a regent during Alexander’s conquest in Asia. He crushed revolts such as that of Agis III of Sparta and managed the affairs of Greece in Alexander’s absence. Without Antipater, Greece would have faced numerous issues, mainly due to revolts and uprisings that would not have been suppressed without his rule as regent <a href="#Bibliography_contents_10">[10]</a>. Views on Antipater, similar to Parmenion, varied from person to person. Since he suppressed revolts and uprisings, many who sympathized with the individuals who were involved in those activities may have felt frustrated by the regent as he had suppressed the events. Others may have shown admiration for his ability to manage Greek affairs in the absence of Alexander the Great. A third notable individual who was involved in the conquest, was Alexander’s father, Philip II of Macedon. Although Alexander was known for his strategic military feats and for expanding the empire, it was his father who created the empire in its early stages, cementing Macedonian rule over the Greek city states by creating the League of Corinth <a href="#Bibliography_contents_11">[11]</a>. He was also the one who revolutionized the Phalanx formation, which proved to be very efficient in the wars that were to come under his son’s rule of Greece <a href="#Bibliography_contents_12">[12]</a>. Views on Philip II were likely very controversial at the time, as he spread Macedonian influence throughout all of the city states, changing the way of life through military and diplomacy. However, many may have admired him for his ability to assert control and unite the city states in their struggle against the Persians.

<h2 id="paragraph_title_5" style="text-align: center; color: #000;">Did this conquest lead to the development or demise of Greek civilization?</h2>
<p id="paragraph_5" style="text-align: center; color: #000;">Greek civilization expanded territory, defeated its enemy, spread its culture, started the Hellenistic period and many other things. However, the empire established by Alexander after the conquest eventually fell due to internal strife and power struggles. The strife inevitably led to power being concentrated amongst the Diadochi who were generals and in some cases rivals of Alexander the Great. These individuals started the Diadochi Wars, which caused lots of instability to the empire and led to major struggles motivated by competing interests. Alexander passed away due to a fever. It is unknown what exactly caused the fever but it is likely that it was typhoid fever, as it was prevalent in ancient Babylon where Alexander had passed away. Despite the complicated legacy of Alexander's wars, the conquest is considered one of the greatest military accomplishments in all of human history, and has made Alexander the Great one of the most notorious historical figures of all time, with many hearing his name but not fully knowing what he had accomplished over his life<a href="#Bibliography_contents_13">[13]</a>.
